# this will be like the main of the "math" project ... in which we'll keep all the functions
# math will calculate nth root's
# we will implement a power function
# facotrial function
# some basic descriptive stats as well as a random number generator
# maybe add some distributions like norm, poisson, binomial
# It's basically like recreating the Python math package for fun

#import NewtonNthRoot

# Example:
#def sqrt(x):
    #return NewtonNthRoot.nRoot(x, n=2)
